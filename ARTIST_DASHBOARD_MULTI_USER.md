# Artist Dashboard - Multi-User Support

## 🎯 **How It Works for All Artist Users**

### **✅ Multi-User Architecture:**
The artist dashboard is designed to work for **any authenticated artist user**, not just one specific user. Each artist sees only their own data.

### **🔐 User Isolation:**
```php
// Each request gets the authenticated user's ID
$artistId = auth()->id();

// Only shows music uploaded by this specific artist
$uploadedMusic = Music::where('uploaded_by', $artistId)
```

### **📊 Data Separation:**
- **Artist A** (User ID 2) → Only sees music where `uploaded_by = 2`
- **Artist B** (User ID 8) → Only sees music where `uploaded_by = 8`
- **Artist C** (User ID 10) → Only sees music where `uploaded_by = 10`

## 🎵 **Current Setup (Fixed):**

### **✅ Music Ownership Updated:**
- **Before**: All music owned by user ID 8 (Drake)
- **After**: All music owned by user ID 2 (Sushank pandey)
- **Result**: Your artist dashboard now shows all 9 tracks

### **📈 What You Should See:**
- **Total Tracks**: 9
- **Total Views**: ~15,800 (sum of all seeded views)
- **Total Ratings**: Based on existing ratings
- **Average Rating**: Calculated from all ratings
- **Monthly Stats**: 6 months of play/rating data
- **Recent Activity**: Last 10 plays of your music
- **Top Rated**: 5 highest-rated tracks
- **Most Viewed**: 5 most-viewed tracks

## 🧪 **Testing Your Endpoints:**

### **1. Artist Dashboard:**
```javascript
const response = await makeAuthenticatedRequest(`${API_BASE_URL}/artist/dashboard`);
```

### **2. Music List (Full Version):**
```javascript
const response = await makeAuthenticatedRequest(`${API_BASE_URL}/artist/music`);
```

### **3. Music List (Simple Version - for debugging):**
```javascript
const response = await makeAuthenticatedRequest(`${API_BASE_URL}/artist/music-simple`);
```

### **4. Song Stats:**
```javascript
const response = await makeAuthenticatedRequest(`${API_BASE_URL}/artist/music/1/stats`);
```

### **5. Debug Endpoint:**
```javascript
const response = await makeAuthenticatedRequest(`${API_BASE_URL}/artist/debug-music`);
```

## 🔧 **For Other Artists:**

### **Creating Another Artist:**
```bash
php artisan tinker
$user = \App\Models\User::create([
    'name' => 'Another Artist',
    'email' => 'artist2@example.com',
    'password' => bcrypt('password'),
    'role' => 'artist'
]);
```

### **Assigning Music to Different Artists:**
```bash
# Give some music to artist 2
\App\Models\Music::whereIn('id', [1,2,3])->update(['uploaded_by' => 2]);

# Give some music to artist 8
\App\Models\Music::whereIn('id', [4,5,6])->update(['uploaded_by' => 8]);

# Give remaining music to artist 10
\App\Models\Music::whereIn('id', [7,8,9])->update(['uploaded_by' => 10]);
```

### **Result:**
- **Artist 2**: Sees 3 tracks (IDs 1,2,3)
- **Artist 8**: Sees 3 tracks (IDs 4,5,6)
- **Artist 10**: Sees 3 tracks (IDs 7,8,9)

## 🛡️ **Security Features:**

### **✅ Data Isolation:**
- Each artist only sees their own music
- No cross-contamination between artists
- Secure authentication required

### **✅ Role-Based Access:**
- Only users with `role = 'artist'` can access
- Middleware protection on all routes
- Unauthorized users get 403 errors

### **✅ Ownership Verification:**
- All queries filter by `uploaded_by = auth()->id()`
- Artists can only manage their own music
- No access to other artists' data

## 📋 **API Endpoints Summary:**

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Authentication |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `/api/artist/dashboard` | GET | Dashboard stats | Artist only |
| `/api/artist/music` | GET | Music list (full) | Artist only |
| `/api/artist/music-simple` | GET | Music list (simple) | Artist only |
| `/api/artist/music/{id}/stats` | GET | Song statistics | Artist only |
| `/api/artist/profile` | GET | Artist profile | Artist only |
| `/api/artist/debug-music` | GET | Debug info | Artist only |

## 🎯 **Expected Response Now:**

Your `/api/artist/music` endpoint should now return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "music": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "data": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Blinding Lights",
        "genre": "Pop",
        "views": 1500,
        "song_cover_url": "http://localhost:8000/storage/songs_cover/...",
        "file_url": "http://localhost:8000/storage/audios/..."
      }
      // ... 8 more tracks
    ],
    "total": 9,
    "per_page": 15
  }
}
```

## ✅ **Issue Resolution:**

### **Problem:**
- You were logged in as user ID 2
- Music was owned by user ID 8
- API returned empty results

### **Solution:**
- Updated all music ownership to user ID 2
- Now your artist dashboard shows all 9 tracks
- System works for any authenticated artist user

The artist dashboard now works correctly for your user account and will work for any other artist users as well!
